# EECS 590: Reinforcement Learning

This repository contains the source code, documentation and work for the mini projects assigned during the **EECS 590: Reinforcement Learning** course at the **University of North Dakota** (Spring 2026).

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized by project/assignment to keep implementations isolated. I'll probably change this eventually.
