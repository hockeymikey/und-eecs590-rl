# Daily Note - 2026-02-17

## Focus
- Align repository to Version 1 rubric requirements.

## Quick Scratch
- Need explicit DP coverage beyond value iteration.
- Need train/eval entrypoint and artifact persistence.
- Need requirements file and cleaner folder separation.

## Experiments Run
- Command: `python3 scripts/run_windy.py train --algorithm policy_iteration`
- Hyperparameters: default
- Result: model + convergence artifacts generated

## Open Questions
- [ ] What exact cookiecutter variant does instructor expect (if strict)?
- [ ] Does the instructor want model-based belief updates implemented now or only scaffolding?

## Next Actions
- [ ] Add optional Monte Carlo/TD baselines for V2 readiness.
- [ ] Add WandB/TensorBoard logging hooks after instructor confirmation.
