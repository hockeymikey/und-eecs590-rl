# Notes Workflow

Use this folder for in-repo notes without cluttering assignment code.

## Structure
- `docs/notes/templates/`: reusable templates.
- `docs/notes/YYYY-MM-DD-*.md`: daily scratch notes.
- `docs/notes/concepts-*.md`: topic summaries after cleanup.

## Suggested cadence
1. Start each work session by creating a daily note from `templates/daily-note.md`.
2. Capture confusion/questions in `Open Questions` while coding.
3. End session by moving durable takeaways into a concept note.
4. Link command outputs, figures, and artifact paths in the note for reproducibility.
